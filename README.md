# Project-Snake
Hello! This project was made using HTML, Javascript and CSS! This project features a really common game for everybody, the "Snake" game where you start with a small snake trying to catch the apples (in this case) in order to grow in length. In this project, the snake's head is represented as a lightblue color and the body is represented as a darker blue. The game starts after pressing one of the arrow keys on the keyboard. Once the snake eats an apple it will grow in length by 1. The game ends if the snake hits a border of the grid or if the snake touches its tail. At the end of the game a "Game over!" message will be displayed and a "Reset button" will be created which will allow the user to play the game again. Enjoy!
